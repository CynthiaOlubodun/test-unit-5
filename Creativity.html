            <p>Our imagination is <span class="pink-bg">Boundless!</span> 
            Creativity acts almost as a sieve. 
            Enabling us to gather our <span class="yellow-bg">Unique perspectives</span>into one place. 
            Our imagination is influenced by our environment. 
            Through our senses, memories, and socialisations. 
            Our brain needs a way to process all the excess information we have collated over time. 
            Hence <span class="font">IMAGINATION</span> an abstract version of our reality. 
            It is our <Span class="lavander font">Creativity</Span>that we then use to mould these abstract images and thoughts into clear, distinct <span class="green-bg">MASTERPIECES.</span></p>
